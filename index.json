Tabular implementation.  See that link for code description and some experiments.    Question  Why should MuZero be better than other deep RL algorithms (in particular DQN)? The paper, \u0026ldquo;When to use parametric models in reinforcement learning?\u0026quot;, goes into this question but with an emphasis on a different model-based algorithm  They define planning in an unusual manner as using \u0026ldquo;more computation without additional data to improve predictions and behavior\u0026rdquo;  The \u0026ldquo;usual\u0026rdquo; definition being the use of a (learned) transition and reward model to compute a value function or policy   The reasons they give for why parameteric model-based planning might outperform non-parameteric (experience replay) planning are not that clear to me, but may include:  Inductive bias of the parameteric model (improving generalization) Improved exploration through use of the model Improved credit assignment (\u0026ldquo;backward planning\u0026rdquo;)     To answer the question, I think the reason MuZero might outperfom DQN is the second reason: that it exhibits better exploration  This isn\u0026rsquo;t the typical kind of improved exploration through model use that you get with e.g., R-max. Instead, because the learned value function is approximate, if the learned model is \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo;, then you can use additional computation to select better actions in the environment than you would if you behaved greedily with respect to the value function itself.  Where \u0026ldquo;additional computation\u0026rdquo; means running MCTS. This means that the actions you take will, on average, be better. Which intuitively should mean that you\u0026rsquo;ll learn about the optimal policy and its value function more quickly.  And reach different parts of the state space that have higher value.   Which can be viewed as improved exploration.   This works for the definition of \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;more sample efficient\u0026rdquo;  But that additional computation takes more resources and time, so if you defined \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; as the algorithm that provides the best solution given some amount of time, DQN might outperform MuZero.

It\u0026rsquo;s a nice write up and was helpful in doing this project.\nI thought implementing a similar project myself would be worth doing nevertheless because:\n They don\u0026rsquo;t provide access to any data or code Their agent seems to behave a bit repetitively I was curious whether a different action-space or model would work better As stated, I wanted to play a better AI myself   TensorKart is a project that developed a Mario Kart 64 AI. That project (and associated blog post) was also helpful, and provided the technical approach roughly followed in this project.\nGame AI in general There\u0026rsquo;s a ton of work on game playing. Most of it focuses on reinforcement learning (RL). This is because RL / approximate dynamic programming is currently the best approach to the problem. See for example OpenAI five or Deepmind starcraft II AI  or AlphaGo. RL is the best approach in these game playing scenarios because (among other reasons):\n It\u0026rsquo;s possible to collect a large amount of training data through simulation. The training and testing distributions closely or exactly match. The agent can benefit from competitive self play. There\u0026rsquo;s an easily accessible reward function (e.g., win/lose, damage, deaths) that aligns well with the true goal (developing a competitive agent).  Dataset The dataset consists of a set of matches. See Appendix 1 for details. Main points:\n  mupen64plus was used for emulating the N64. The dataset consists of a set of gameplay matches.  In total about 175,000 frames representing about 6 hours of gameplay.   Matches were played between blue DK and the highest level game AI Kirby.  This allows the network to identify which agent it controls. Extending this to multiple characters would require e.g., adding a feature indicating the controlled character.   All matches were played on the dreamland stage. Items were included to make it more interesting.  Here\u0026rsquo;s a short clip selected from the dataset to give a sense for the behavior being imitated:\n Approach I started with behavioral cloning (BC), which is supervised learning using a dataset of expert demonstrations, despite it being a worse-performing approach than RL because:\n It\u0026rsquo;s simpler to implement than RL methods.  Allows for becoming familiar with the emulator in a simplified setting.   It provides a nice baseline for comparison. It has more predictable computational costs than RL.  The main disadvantages of behavioral cloning are:\n It may take a lot of data to achieve good performance (see Appendix 2). The resulting agent will not perform significantly better than the expert providing the data.   It might perform slightly better due to decreased reaction time, but that\u0026rsquo;s not particularly interesting or fun to play against.  Observation space  A requirement for this project was that the AI has to act on image observations.  There are some alternatives to this observation space (e.g., operating on the game RAM).   A single image is not a Markovian representation of the state.  It\u0026rsquo;s unclear to what extent multiple images would improve performance. For this reason, different numbers of frames were considered as input (fixed history in the CNN case, and complete history in theory in the RNN case).    Action space I considered two action spaces:\n Exclusive multiclass action space consisting of common SSB64 moves.   This is what the cs231n project uses. The actions include the buttons, the axes, and smash combinations (A + left, A + right, etc).  A multi-discrete action space with a value for each joystick axis, and one value for the button.   This action space seemed like it should allow for more efficient learning.  Models  A Resnet-9, multi-frame model.   Using a four-frame history of grayscale images.  An RNN with Resnet feature extractor.   This takes as input individual grayscale images at each timestep. Same visual feature extractor as the fixed-length history model.  The models were implemented in pytorch. See Appendix 3 for training details.\nExperiments and Results  Edit (05/18/2020): I never ran this evaluation because gym-mupen64plus had a number of issues with it  See the appendix 4 for more details    Deployment The models were deployed using gym-mupen64plus.\nConclusion and Future Work Despite not being the best approach to the problem, behavioral cloning was a helpful place to start in creating a SSB64 AI. I learned a fair amount about emulating the game (see Appendix 4), pytorch ignite (see training script), regularizing RNNs (see Appendix 5).\n\nThe main direction for future work is applying RL to the problem. As discussed in Appendix 4, the N64 isn\u0026rsquo;t the most convenient environment for RL for technical reasons, so most of the effort in applying RL would be in creating a convenient environment.\nAppendix 1: Dataset collection  Images were collected by adapting the TensorKart codebase  See this script   I collected the data on a mac. The Inputs python package used in TensorKart doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on mac for joysticks, so I made some changes to the input plugin for mupen64plus to accept a command line argument for a filepath at which to store the actions received. See here for the fork containing those changes. Image-action pairs were created by finding, for each image, the non-null action that occurred most recently following the collected image, up to a maximum of 0.05 seconds after the image, or if no non-null action occurred, a noop action was selected.  Appendix 2: Imitation Learning  Some notes on the topic.  Appendix 3: Model and training details  See here for the hyperparams used in the CNN case.  Appendix 4: N64 as an RL environment  mupen64plus seems to be the most popular N64 emulator. It is not designed for use in RL.  The design is based on a core module that has plugins for video, audio, controller input, etc. The plugins don\u0026rsquo;t communicate directly. Providing a unified interface for RL would require a significant amount of effort, with the implementation options being:  Wrap the core and all plugins in an adapter program.   And also interpret / provide access to the RAM.  Use BizHawk   Bizhawk seems to have already done option 1, and is typically used in tool-assisted SSB64 gameplay. It only seems to work on windows for now, with linux support being developed.     Alternatively, you could use gym-mupen64plus  It takes screenshots of the game and parses them to compute rewards. The main problems are:  Because the observations are from screenshots, the hardware might influence the rate of observations and their alignment with actions taken.  This is complicated to deal with, as can be seen in the dataset formatting details of this project.   gym-mupen64plus for SSB64 attempts to automatically select characters in versus mode, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t work in my case.  The implementation assumes the selector for the AI appears in the same location every time.  In my emulation of the game it was random.   Directly performing these tasks by operating on the RAM is clearly a better approach.   Parsing the screen for the reward seems to work, but breaks with small changes.  Using the RAM directly would be faster and more reliable.        Appendix 5: RNNs why use them, how to optimize and regularize them Why use an RNN?  I tried using an RNN because I was curious to what extent it would improve performance.  The reasons it might improve performance are:  A reasonable-size, fixed-frame history may not represent a Markovian representation of the environment. The inductive bias of the RNN may provide some benefits (e.g., consistency or smoothness).      Optimizing and regularizing RNNs  First, note that RNNs have gone out of fashion lately (at least in NLP).   Transformer networks are generally being preferred.  Here\u0026rsquo;s a paper that tries to explain why.   There are a lot of tricks for regularizing and optimizing RNNs.  This is a good paper on it that is somewhat recent.  It focuses on NLP, but the advice seemed to help in my case.   I implemented or copied some of the regularization methods here.   One decision to make in RNN training is whether to use \u0026ldquo;stateful\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;stateless\u0026rdquo; training.  See this description and this explanation.  The gist is that you need to use stateful (maintaining the hidden state across batches) training if you want the network to learn to maintain memory beyond the length of the BPTT.

Forward kinematics answers this question    Schematic  First, draw a schematic of the robot arm, assigning frames to the different joints Figure 3 in these notes provides a schematic for a two-revolute-joint robot (called an revolute-revolute (RR) manipulator)  revolute means the joint rotates, and the other option is prismatic meaning it translates linearly along its axis Also, here\u0026rsquo;s a schematic with the frames labeled    DH Parameters  Second, derive Denavit–Hartenberg parameters  DH parameters are one convention for expressing information about robotic manipulators They make it easy to derive the transformation from each frame to the end-effector frame    Transformation Matrix  Given the DH parameters, we can derive a transformation matrix from each frame to the frame of the end-effector  First, build transformation matrices from each frame to the next Second, multiply these all together to find the transformation from the 0th frame to the end-effector frame   Section 3 of the referenced notes provides the transformation matrix for the RR manipulator Here\u0026rsquo;s the code for computing the transformation matrix given the DH parameters  Inverse Kinematics  We just looked at the forward kinematics, which tell you the position of the end-effector given the configuration of the joints What about the opposite question: given a (desired) position of the end-effector how do you figure out the joints that achieve that position? This turns out to be a more difficult problem to solve  Since the forward kinematics involve nonlinear operations (sine, cosine), typically there\u0026rsquo;s no analytical solution for the joints There can be many solutions, and there can also be no solutions We\u0026rsquo;ll look at one method for solving the problem    Jacobian  The method we\u0026rsquo;ll use requires the Jacobian The forward kinematics map from the joints config to the end-effector position  It\u0026rsquo;s a function mapping from dimension n to dimension m If you differentiate each output with respect to each input, and arrange those derivatives in a matrix, that matrix is the Jacobian   Given the transformation matrices, there\u0026rsquo;s a simple algorithm for finding the Jacobian The code implementing the algorithm and along with a description can be found here  Inverse Jacobian Method  The method we use for solving the inverse kinematics problem is called the inverse Jacobian method  It\u0026rsquo;s an iterative method that  Linearizes the function using the Jacobian Solves for the change in joint configuration that moves the end-effector closest to the target position  This is accomplished by formulating the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian, hence the name   Updates the configuration Repeats until the target is reached or it\u0026rsquo;s determined that it cannot be reached    Here\u0026rsquo;s a solid tutorial on it that steps through the logic and math  Here\u0026rsquo;s my implementation of it   This method does not explicitly deal with constraints on the movement of the manipulator  A faster solver that handles constraints will be the topic of a future post    Walkthrough Hardware  The two-link manipulator is just the connected servos from the previous post, which looks like:   Software  Download and setup the project code  git clone https://github.com/wulfebw/robotics_rl.git cd robotics_rl sudo python setup.py develop   Run the tutorial code that randomly samples an end-effector position, and then solves for a joint configuration to achieves that position  import time import rlrobo.manipulator manipulator = rlrobo.manipulator.build_RR_manipulator(l1=1,l2=2) while True: pos = manipulator.random_position() manipulator.set_end_effector_position(pos) time.sleep(1)  Result  ","date":1518480000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518480000,"objectID":"0c083f688bb422ad5f62147855e259f5","permalink":"https://wulfebw.github.io/post/03-two-link-programmatic-control/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/03-two-link-programmatic-control/","section":"post","summary":"Controlling a robotic arm with reinforcement learning 3: two-link programmatic control","tags":[],"title":"Two Link Programmatic Control","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["robotics"],"content":"Outline  Servos will control the joints of the robotic arm.

This research makes an initial step in this direction, using hierarchical recurrent neural networks within a Recurrent Q-Network.","tags":[],"title":"Playing Atari with Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["rl","dqn"],"content":" update: see rainbow sanity check the implementation  come up with a simple dataset and see if the DQN can correctly learn values for it an example is a contextual bandit problem where you have two possible states, and two actions, where one action is +1 and the other -1 generally, an rl method should work on 1-step and 2-step mdps both with and without random rewards and transitions   updating the target network  check freeze rate this should be between every 100 updates and every 40000   batch size  this can be hard to set and depends on CPU vs GPU as well as the state dimensionality start with 32 and increase the goal should be to have each experience replayed some number of times on average  this is determined by the size of the replay memory and batch size     replay memory  replay memory size 1,000 to 10,000,000   action selection  softmax vs e-greedy  softmax typically works better if the temperature is tuned well     learning rate  try values between 0.01 and 0.00001 generally   state sampling  only relevant when initial-state distribution can be controlled if the important rewards are common then uniform sampling of the initial state might work if the important reward is rare then you\u0026rsquo;ll need to oversample these states  to do this in a principled manner, you need to know the relative probability of sampling states in the original MDP versus the proposal MDP (i.e., you need to do importance sampling)   prioritized sampling can also help if you are dealing with rare, significant rewards   normalizing input  mean center and normalize to get the stats, if it\u0026rsquo;s stationary, run it for 100,000 samples and compute mean and std dev or if the range of the input is available then you can use that  subtract the average of the end points divide by half the total range     max episode length  when ending an episode not at a terminal state, be careful not to label that as a terminal state this value will impact the distribution over the state space   terminal states  you need to handle this so that the target value is zero if it\u0026rsquo;s terminal   discount  \u0026lt;
